Refactoring Chat messages using Hashmap Storage
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to refactor the existing chat application to use a Hashmap storage system for storing messages.
Task 1: Extending the application we created in class, update the socketio.on('message') event handler in your app.py to store messages to a global variable message_storage, and also retrieve those messages and print them to the terminal.
Task 2: Test **socket** in postman or your own client by sending messages, which should be logged to the terminal.
Task 3: (BONUS) Add your own twist to the chatroom, User login, Nicer UI, Client Specific messages, whatever you think would be cool! Play around with it.
